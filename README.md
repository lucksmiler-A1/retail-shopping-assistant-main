## Overview

The Retail Shopping Assistant is an AI-powered blueprint that provides a comprehensive interface for an intelligent retail shopping advisor. Built with LangGraph for agent orchestration, it features multi-agent architecture, real-time streaming responses, image-based search, and intelligent shopping cart management.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **Intelligent Product Search**: Find products using natural language or images
- 🛒 **Smart Cart Management**: Add, remove, and manage shopping cart items
- 🖼️ **Visual Search**: Upload images to find similar products
- 💬 **Conversational AI**: Natural language interactions
- 🔒 **Content Safety**: Built-in moderation and safety checks
- ⚡ **Real-time Streaming**: Live response generation
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface

### Architecture

![Shopping Assistant Diagram](notebook/shopping-assistant-diagram.jpg)

The application follows a microservices architecture with specialized agents for different tasks:
- **Chain Server**: Main API with LangGraph orchestration
- **Catalog Retriever**: Product search and recommendations
- **Memory Retriever**: User context and cart management
- **Guardrails**: Content safety and moderation
- **UI**: React-based frontend interface

For service and request-flow details, see
[Architecture and Request Flow](AGENTS.md#2-architecture-and-request-flow).

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine**: Version 28.3.3+ with Docker Compose plugin (required for
  reliable loopback-only port publishing)
- **NVIDIA NGC Account**: For API access ([Get API Key](https://ngc.nvidia.com/))
- **Hardware**: 4x H100 GPUs (preferred) or 4x A100 GPUs (minimum) for local deployment, or cloud access

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/retail-shopping-assistant.git
   cd retail-shopping-assistant
   ```

2. **Authenticate with NVIDIA Container Registry**:
   ```bash
   docker login nvcr.io
   ```
   Use `$oauthtoken` as the username and your NGC API key as the password.

3. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   export NGC_API_KEY=your_nvapi_key_here
   export LLM_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY
   export EMBED_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY
   export RAIL_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY
   export LOCAL_NIM_CACHE=~/.cache/nim
   mkdir -p "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE"
   chmod a+w "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE"
   ```

4. **Launch the application**:
   
   **Option A: Local Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Start local NIMs (requires 4x H100 GPUs)
   docker compose -f docker-compose-nim-local.yaml up -d
   
   # Build and launch the application
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
   ```
   
   **Option B: Cloud Deployment** (no local GPUs required):
   ```bash
   # Configure to use NVIDIA API Catalog endpoints
   export CONFIG_OVERRIDE=config-build.yaml
   
   # Build and launch the application
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
   ```

   Cloud mode uses `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` for image
   embeddings. Local NIM mode continues to use NV-CLIP.

5. **Access the application**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

   > **Security boundary:** The supplied deployment is a local, single-operator
   > blueprint and binds its host ports to loopback. It has no built-in end-user
   > authentication. Do not expose it to untrusted users or use real customer or
   > sensitive data. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before enabling remote access.

6. **Stop the containers**:
   
   **Option A: Local Deployment**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-nim-local.yaml down
   ```
   
   **Option B: Cloud Deployment**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
   ```

For detailed installation instructions, see [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Deploy on NVIDIA Brev

For a streamlined cloud deployment experience, you can deploy the Retail Shopping Assistant on **NVIDIA Brev** using GPU Environment Templates (Launchables):

**[NVIDIA Brev Deployment Guide](docs/BREV.md)** - Complete step-by-step instructions for deploying on Brev

### Why Choose NVIDIA Brev?

- **One-Click Deployment**: Pre-configured GPU environments with automatic setup
- **Managed Infrastructure**: No need to manage servers or GPU clusters
- **Secure Access**: Built-in secure tunneling for web interface access  
- **Flexible Resources**: Choose from H100, A100, and other GPU configurations
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for actual usage time

The Brev deployment guide walks you through the entire process from creating a Launchable to accessing your fully functional retail shopping assistant.
